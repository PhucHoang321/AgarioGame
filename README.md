# Good software practice (GSP)	
	1.Well-named, commented and short methods : 
		We use lots of small comment on some methods. That tell the reader know what that actual do.
	2.Single Responsibility Principle:
		For example, in MainPage.xaml.cs we have it do all the GUI work,
		and in World Class we have it handle all the incoming data such as, add player, add food,e.t.c..
